Additionally, I used a unigram for the words; testing out bigrams/trigrams/(skip gram for word2vec) on the models could see increased performance. For the Word2Vec methods, tuning the parameter of window_size parameter could give performance improvement. Specifically for the Word2Vec methods, I believe that a larger training set could also lead to higher performance. Lastly, for the word2vec models, the embeddings were used to find embedding averages and summations, but other features could be created by using min/max."

I would expect the model with the largest window_size to be the best performer, given it looks at more surrounding words to determine a word's context. Grading off of training AUC's, this logic is supported as the window_size=5 model has the highest training AUC, however, it does not have the best AUC for it's validation data. This could be because at a range of 4 words from the word predicted, those surrounding words could be more related, therefore allowing the model to generalize more accurately. At windowsize=5, a word 5 words away may be unrelated to the word we're trying to predict and lead to lower performance."
